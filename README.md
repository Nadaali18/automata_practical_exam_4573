## Question 1 - DFA Equivalence
Checks if two DFAs accept the same language by comparing outputs on test strings.

## Question 2 - CYK Algorithm
Implements a very basic CYK algorithm using a small grammar in CNF.
Example: Checks if the input "ab" is generated by the grammar.

## Question 3 - Turing Machine Prime Length
Simulates a Turing Machine that accepts unary strings if their length is a prime number.
